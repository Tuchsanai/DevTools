Keep face, proportions, colors, hat, badge and neckerchief identical to the reference; Nong Som appears exactly once, expressive and friendly.
Style: clean flat vector cartoon, thick smooth navy outlines, soft cel shading, white background, palette navy / blue / teal with orange accents, rounded cards, crisp large legible labels, generous whitespace; matches the chapter 001 classroom illustration set. Shared metaphor (keep consistent across the series): container = colored shipping container box; Pod = rounded translucent teal cabin box that wraps one or more shipping containers and carries one small IP tag; Node = cargo ship (worker ships lab-worker and lab-worker2); Control Plane = harbor control tower on the dock (lab-control-plane); image registry = warehouse of container blueprints.
Text (verbatim, at most 4 short labels): "restart db: ออเดอร์ยังอยู่"; "ลบ Pod: ออเดอร์หาย"; "emptyDir"; "IP ใหม่".
Constraints: only the verbatim labels listed above, spelled exactly (Thai and English), no other words, no gibberish or pseudo-text, no extra speech bubbles with text, no watermark, no signature, no real company logos; do not show Service, NodePort, Deployment, ReplicaSet or Ingress objects or words.

Use case: scientific-educational story illustration (one panel of a continuous story) for a Thai university DevTools course; must teach the concept correctly at a glance.
Asset type: landscape 3:2 educational story illustration for Thai Kubernetes Pod lesson (README figure, about 1536x1024).
Scene: One left-to-right setup flow in three numbered stages (digits 1, 2, 3 in small circles). Stage 1 (left): Nong Som at a student laptop; an arrow labeled docker run goes to a big rounded card / giant shipping container labeled k8s-lab, with one small door on its side; a small hourglass icon next to the card shows "wait a moment while it starts up" (no text on the hourglass). Stage 2 (middle): a glowing tunnel labeled ssh -p 2223 runs from the laptop into that side door of k8s-lab, with a small opened padlock icon (no text). Stage 3 (right, inside the k8s-lab card): a big button labeled k8s-up, and above it the harbor appears: exactly one harbor control tower and two cargo ships, with a bracket over all three labeled 3 nodes Ready and green check marks. No Pods yet.

Asset type: landscape 3:2 educational story illustration for Thai Kubernetes Pod lesson (README figure, about 1536x1024).
Scene: Everything happens inside a big rounded card labeled k8s-lab (the lab container). Top: a generic code-repository cloud (no logo) with a folder labeled DevTools. A stream of folder icons labeled git clone flows down into a cabinet folder labeled /workspace/DevTools inside the card. From that folder a path of stepping stones leads down several nested folders to a highlighted open folder at the end; Nong Som walks along the path holding a map and arrives at the highlighted folder, whose open drawer shows two sub-folders labeled labs and som-shop. A signpost at the start of the path says cd .../02_LAB.

```text
Use case: realistic software screenshot for a Thai university DevTools lab README; students must recognize the exact UI they will see.
Asset type: landscape 16:10 high-resolution realistic desktop screenshot (about 1600x1000), crisp UI text, looks like a real screen capture, NOT a cartoon.
Scene: A real-looking Visual Studio Code window, Dark Modern theme, attached to a running container. Bottom-left status bar shows the remote indicator with the text "Container tuchsanai/devtools-kind:2569_1 (k8s-lab)". Left Explorer sidebar shows folder 02_LAB with sub-folders images, labs, som-shop and file README.md. The editor area shows README.md open with a few faint markdown lines. The bottom panel is open with tabs PROBLEMS, OUTPUT, DEBUG CONSOLE, TERMINAL, PORTS; the PORTS tab is selected and shows a badge 1. The PORTS table has column headers Port, Forwarded Address, Running Process, Origin and exactly one row: Port 8080, Forwarded Address localhost:8080, Running Process kubectl port-forward pod/web 8080:80, Origin Auto Forwarded. The mouse cursor hovers that row, revealing the small globe icon next to the forwarded address, with its tooltip "Open in Browser" visible.
Annotation overlay (the only non-realistic part): a thick orange rounded rectangle around the PORTS tab and a thick orange circle around the globe icon, connected by a short orange arrow; in the lower-right corner a small sticker of Nong Som (the attached character reference, kept small, about 12% of image width) pointing at the globe icon.
Character sticker: Nong Som exactly as in the attached reference sheet 00-character-som.png — chubby orange tabby cat, white chest and muzzle, big green eyes, navy captain hat with white ship-wheel badge, teal neckerchief; appears exactly once, small, in the corner.
Text: all UI text must be real English VS Code labels spelled exactly as listed above; keep other text minimal or blurred; no gibberish.
Constraints: realistic flat UI rendering like an actual screenshot, no 3D, no cartoon editor, no watermark, no extra windows; exactly one row in the PORTS table; do not show passwords.

The Activity Bar on the left has the Containers (whale-free generic container cube) icon selected, and the side bar title reads CONTAINERS. Under a section CONTAINERS there is a group "tuchsanai/devtools-kind:2569_1" containing one running container item with a green play icon labeled "k8s-lab  Up 10 minutes". The user has right-clicked that item and a context menu is open with these items in order: View Logs, Attach Shell, Attach Visual Studio Code, Inspect, Open in Browser, Stop, Restart, Remove. The item "Attach Visual Studio Code" is highlighted (hover). The editor area on the right shows the VS Code Welcome page faintly.
Annotation overlay (the only non-realistic part): a thick orange rounded rectangle around the "k8s-lab" container item and another around the "Attach Visual Studio Code" menu item, with a short orange arrow between them; in the lower-right corner a small sticker of Nong Som (the attached character reference, kept small, about 12% of image width) pointing at the menu item.
